# 🌱 Editing the Game Seed & Concept

When you enter a prompt in Jabali, the system first creates a **game seed** — the foundational blueprint that guides how your game is generated.

From this seed, Jabali creates a fully formed **game concept**, which includes the name, narrative summary, core mechanics, and a poster image.

This page explains how the game seed and concept work, and how you can edit or regenerate them to better match your vision.

## 🌱 What is a Game Seed?

The **game seed** is the starting point for game generation — a structured set of values derived from your initial prompt. It helps Jabali align tone, theme, and gameplay across all generated content.

### 🧬 What’s in a Game Seed?

| Game Type              | Game Seed Fields                                                                 |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Character Simulation** | Character Name, Challenge, Character Bio, Visual Style                           |
| **All Other Games**     | Visual Style, Game Theme                                                         |

## 🎮 What is a Game Concept?
Based on your seed, Jabali creates a Game Concept: a polished, high-level pitch of your game. It includes:

- 🕹️ Game Name
- 📖 Gameplay Description – Mechanics, story loop, or mission structure
- 🎨 Game Poster – An AI-generated visual for inspiration or use as a splash screen

### 🧪 Example Game Concept
🕹️ Title: “Cogs of Solitude”

📖 Description:  
A narrative-driven resource management game where you play as Nova, a reclusive engineer-cat tasked with repairing a derelict starship. Each day, you balance repairs, morale, and unexpected visitors — all while unraveling a hidden mystery.
