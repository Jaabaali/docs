## ‚ú® What You Can Generate
Just like on Discord, you can generate:

- **üéÆ Core Game Details:** Visual style, writing style, setting, theme  
- **üó∫Ô∏è Level Structure:** Level names, environment descriptions, and story arcs  
- **üßç Characters:** Names, personalities, abilities, and visual portraits  
- **üé® Assets:** Backgrounds, objects, sprites, music, and sound effects

## üß† Prompting Game Content

Each major element of your game ‚Äî scenes, characters, items ‚Äî begins with a **prompt**. Jabali will generate game-ready content using your description.

**Example Prompt (Character):**

> A sleepy raccoon innkeeper who used to be a legendary thief.  
> Outfit: Wears a patched vest and monocle, and always carries a cup of tea.

**Example Prompt (Scene):**

> A wind-swept mountaintop temple at sunset, with broken columns and ringing bells.

You can also edit or regenerate results in one click. For tips, see the [Prompting Guide](asset-prompt-tips.md).
