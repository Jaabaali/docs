| **Setting**    | A haunted forest, alien planet, steampunk city                      |
| **Main Character** | A detective squirrel, a lonely robot, a retired space captain        |
| **Tone/Theme** | Whimsical, dark mystery, coming-of-age, redemption                  |

## ‚ùå Common Prompting Mistakes

| Mistake                   | What to Do Instead                                               |

| Conflicting styles        | Stick to one aesthetic (e.g., don't mix "pixel art" and "realistic") |
| Describing gameplay rules | Focus on **what** appears, not how it functions (for assets)    |
