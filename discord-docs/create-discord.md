# 🎯 Jabali Inference
Using /make this way means the Jabali agents will try to infer which game genre best fits your prompt. If any of the infered genres do not meet your needs, try modifying your prompt or look at genres currently available.

# ✍️ Tips for Writing Great Game Prompts

Creating AI-powered games with Jabali starts with a good prompt. Your prompt is the foundation for how Jabali generates characters, scenes, dialogue, and gameplay mechanics — so crafting it well can make a huge difference!

Use the tips below to get better results and build the game you imagine.

---
## 🎯 1. Start with the Game Concept

Describe the **core idea** of your game in 1–2 sentences. Think of it as your game’s elevator pitch.

**✅ Good Example:**
> A haunted forest mystery where the player must find lost magical artifacts while being followed by a mischievous ghost.

**❌ Less Effective:**
> A cool story game.

## 🏗 2. Use Clear Structure in Prompts

Break down your prompt into **components**. This helps Jabali better understand the elements you're imagining.

### Suggested Format:
- **Setting:** Where does the game take place?
- **Tone or Genre:** Horror, fantasy, sci-fi, slice of life, etc.
- **Main Character(s):** Who is the player or protagonist?
- **Goal:** What is the objective of the game?
- **Gameplay Style:** Visual novel, simulation, arcade, etc.

**Example:**
> A sci-fi visual novel set on a space station orbiting a dying star. The player is an AI maintenance bot who uncovers a conspiracy. The tone is dark and mysterious.

## 🧠 3. Be Descriptive, but Not Overloaded

You want to give **just enough detail** to guide the AI — not so much that it becomes rigid or confusing.

**✅ Balanced Prompt:**
> A cozy forest town populated by talking animals. The player is a fox who delivers letters and solves problems for the townsfolk.

**❌ Too Vague:**
> A game about animals.

**❌ Too Long-Winded:**
> The game takes place in a highly detailed alpine environment where various forest-dwelling animals form a socio-political structure governed by a council of owls. The player navigates this structure through a variety of letter delivery mechanics, seasonal quests, and reputation-building...
