# 🖌️ Editing Prompts for Asset Generation

In Jabali, your prompts are your palette. The assets you see in your game—whether it's a foggy forest, a talking vending machine, or a pirate cat in a bomber jacket—are all generated from your prompts.

This guide will help you effectively edit and refine prompts for **image assets** and **characters**, so your visuals match the world you're imagining.

## 🎨 Asset Prompt Types

There are two types of prompts used in Jabali’s asset generation pipeline:

1. **🖼️ Image Asset Prompts**  
   Used for generating **backgrounds**, **objects**, and **props** (e.g., a magical forest, an arcade cabinet, a laser toaster).

2. **🧍 Character Prompts**  
   Used to generate **character portraits and sprites**, split into:
   - **Physical Appearance**
   - **Outfit**

## 🖼️ 1. Image Asset Prompts

Image prompts are used for objects, environments, and decorative elements in your scenes.

### ✏️ Structure of a Good Prompt

Include:
- **Object or location type** (e.g., forest, robot, treasure chest)
- **Mood or atmosphere** (e.g., cozy, eerie, futuristic)
- **Lighting or time of day**
- **Art style** (optional: pixel art, watercolor, 80s arcade style)

### ✅ Good Prompt Examples

- *A cozy pixel art forest glade at sunset, with glowing mushrooms and tall pine trees*
- *A retro-futuristic arcade cabinet glowing with neon lights, viewed from a side angle*
- *An eerie dungeon hallway in isometric style, lit by flickering torches*

### ❌ Common Issues

| Problem                     | Fix By...                                                         |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Too generic ("a forest")   | Add atmosphere, style, and detail ("a snowy forest with mist")     |
| Conflicting styles         | Stick to one (e.g., don't mix "realistic" with "pixel art")        |
| Vague scene composition    | Mention perspective or layout (e.g., "top-down", "side view")      |

## 🧍 2. Character Prompts

Character prompts are split into two parts:
- **Physical Appearance** – Facial features, body type, hairstyle, age, species, etc.
- **Outfit** – Clothing style, accessories, materials, and colors.

### ✏️ Structure of a Character Prompt

You’ll typically enter something like:

**Physical Appearance:** A tall elven woman with glowing green eyes, silver hair, and pointed ears. 

**Outfit:** Wearing a flowing emerald robe with silver runes and leather boots.


### ✅ Good Prompt Examples

- **Physical Appearance:** *A chubby orange tabby cat with a missing ear and a mischievous grin*  
  **Outfit:** *Wearing a tiny leather aviator jacket and a pair of brass goggles*

- **Physical Appearance:** *A rugged human pirate captain with a scar across his nose and a thick beard*  
  **Outfit:** *Wearing a red velvet coat, a tri-corner hat with a feather, and worn leather boots*

### 🧠 Prompt Tips

|------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Cute & cartoony              | *A bubbly mouse with big eyes and oversized ears, wearing a tutu* |

## 🧪 Iteration Tips

- Use the **“Vary”** button (if available for your asset) if the image isn’t quite right — then refine the prompt.
- Add or remove **specific details** to guide the AI (e.g., change “a coat” to “a wool coat with gold trim”).
- Use consistent styles across characters and scenes to create visual cohesion.

---

## 📌 Pro Tips

- Keep prompts under **3–4 lines** for best results.
- Think visually: use adjectives that convey shape, color, texture, and expression.
- You can use **real-world references** (e.g., "80s fashion", "steampunk armor") to guide style.

## 🧰 Template

Use this structure when crafting character prompts:

**Physical Appearance:** [height, build, species, features, facial expressions, hairstyle]

**Outfit:** [style, materials, colors, accessories]

**Example:**

**Physical Appearance:** A short robot with one glowing eye and rusted metal plating.
**Outfit:** Wearing a patched-up mechanic’s apron covered in tools and grease stains.
