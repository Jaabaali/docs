# 🤖 Using Co-Pilot in the Jabali Desktop Editor

The Jabali Editor includes an integrated **Co-Pilot** — your personal AI assistant that helps you understand, edit, and expand your game using natural language.

Whether you’re tweaking gameplay, fixing logic, editing character bios, or just exploring what’s in your game, Co-Pilot is here to help — all via chat.

## 🧠 What Can Co-Pilot Do?

You can use Co-Pilot to:

- 🔍 **Ask questions** about your game’s characters, levels, logic, or assets  
- 🧩 **Make content edits** (scene descriptions, story flow, dialogue, character traits)  
- 🎨 **Regenerate assets** based on updated prompts  
- 💬 **Debug scenes** or test branching logic  
- 🧪 **Explain code blocks** for game behavior (e.g., roguelike modifiers)  
- 🎯 **Suggest improvements** to writing, pacing, or structure

| Describe assets | “What visual assets are used in Level 3?” |
| Regenerate scene | “Regenerate the dream sequence scene in a noir style.” |
| Debug | “Why does Scene 2 not link to the ending?” |

## ✨ Advanced Co-Pilot Tips

- Co-Pilot has full access to the current project you have open.
- Use **specific scene names** or character names to target your edits.
- Ask it to **compare or summarize** content (e.g., “Summarize all endings”).
- You can **preview Co-Pilot changes** before committing them.

## 🛑 Limitations

- Co-Pilot works on one project at a time.
- It does not access unpublished Discord or Web-only drafts — load them in Editor first.
- Asset regeneration may take longer than text edits.

## 📌 Use Cases

- Polish your narrative with fewer clicks  
- Rapidly iterate character backstories
